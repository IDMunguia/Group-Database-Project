# Group-Database-Project
This project is a colaborative class program that utilizes a database backend for storing information for later use in the Spectre console UI.

There are multiple features to this program:
- Create a family group
- Access a group
- Edit a group
- Delete a group
- Add members to that group
    - Each member has a name, birthday, and a gift idea
- Delete members from that group
- Edit members from that group
- Display a report of all of the groups and their members
- Add sample groups and members to the database
- Assign group members to other group members and suggested gifts accordingly

Whenever a user decides to add a family and make changes, all of the changes will be saved to the database. This means that all of the previous information will load no matter the console instance. 

*NOTE: some exceptions or bugs may still occur.
